\textsc{libmpd} is a client implementation of the MPD music playing
daemon's network protocol. Since the last report (version 0.3.1), several
improvements have been made to the API and protocol compliance.

Maintenance of the project has been transfered (to me), but I do not
personally use MPD anymore, so I mainly take care of cutting releases.
