* TODO Make the MPD version available in MonadMPD :enhancement:
  When connecting, an MPD server responds with its version number.
  The library should record this and make it available as in a Reader monad.
  The StringMPD monad can also support this with an extra version parameter
  to `testMPD'
* TODO Proper position handling :defect:api:
  Some commands take either positions or identifiers, while some take only
  one, yet others can consume either ranges or positions. The current way of
  handling this is clearly not expressive enough and requires ugly run-time
  checks. Find a better way to deal with this.
* TODO Supoprt bytestrings as well as strings in the interface :defect:api:
  Bytestrings can be much faster for lots of text data but seems to be more of
  a pain for casual use. It'd be nice to support both them and ordinary Strings.
